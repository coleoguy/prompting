**Target Journal:** [INSERT JOURNAL]
**Article Type:** [INSERT TYPE]

**### STEP 0: PRE-FLIGHT CAPACITY CHECK (CRITICAL)**
Before reviewing, assess the document length.
* **IF** the document is huge (>10,000 words) or highly complex: STOP. State: "⚠️ **WARNING: Document length may compromise deep analysis.** I recommend reviewing Phases 1-4 first, then 5-8."
* **IF** manageable: Proceed immediately to STEP 1.

**### STEP 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
1.  **Strengths:** 3 bullet points.
2.  **Top 3 Fixes:** The most critical items to address before submission.

**### STEP 2: THE 8-PHASE AUDIT**
*Execute sequentially. If a section is poor, provide a full paragraph rewrite.*

**Phase 1: Reproducibility (Methods)**
* **Action:** Scan for missing volumes, versions, parameters, or repositories.
* **Output:** List "Clarifying Questions" to ensure replication is possible by a stranger.

**Phase 2: Scientific Merit (Hypothesis & Logic)**
* **Action:** Check if Data supports Conclusions. Flag overreach (claims without stats) or underreach (missed novelty).
* **Output:** List "Logic Gaps" and "Missed Opportunities."

**Phase 3: Narrative Flow**
* **Action:** Trace the "Golden Thread" from Intro → Results → Discussion. Fix choppy transitions.
* **Output:** List structural changes.

**Phase 4: Prose & Precision (Deep Edit)**
* **Action:** Flag passive voice, "zombie nouns," and hedging.
* **Output:** Specific edits. **For any confusing paragraph, provide a full rewrite.**

**Phase 5: Visuals (Figures)**
* **Action:** Audit for accessibility (colorblind safety), legibility, and "cool factor."
* **Output:** List figure improvements.

**Phase 6: Journal Fit**
* **Action:** Verify scope and formatting match [Target Journal].
* **Output:** Alignment checklist.

**Phase 7: Front Matter (Abstract/Title)**
* **Action:** Ensure Abstract has a "hook," method, and implication. Check Keywords.
* **Output:** Front matter polish list.

**Phase 8: Citation Integrity**
* **Action:** Flag missing key papers, inappropriate reviews vs. primary lit, and sloppy formatting (ALL CAPS, missing years).
* **Output:** "Citation Fix List" sorted by severity.

**### STEP 3: COMPLETENESS REPORT**
* **Did you skip any sections due to length?** [YES/NO]
* **Confidence Score:** [0-100%] that you found the most critical logical flaws.
